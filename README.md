## **Academic Thesis**  
- 2009 - UniPi - M.sc. Applied Math (Game Theory in Social Negotiations)
- 2011 - UniPi - M.sc. Corporate Auditing and Criminal Law (Corruption Risk Management),
- 2022 - UniMi - M.sc. Cybersecurity (Organization and Management)
- 2025 - UniUd - Pg.Dip. Filosofia AI & Informazioni - Conceptual Model of Local Abstraction Reticula



## **RLA**  
- **Reticula Local Abstraction** provide a theoretical and philosophical framework for modeling complex multilevel systems.
- They integrate two concepts rarely formalized together: emergence (the emergence of non-deducible macro properties) and undecidability (logical-computational limits intrinsic to Turing-like systems).
- The model provides a language and a set of axioms for analyzing how information and computational constraints are transmitted or blocked when moving between disciplinary levels.
- Bryophyte case study: the construction of a compact topology with twenty levels, parameters and micro-founded equations shows that a purely simulated system can produce synthetic observations indistinguishable from real ones for a botanist, operationalizing Popperian falsifiability


## **RLA, Epistemic CNN & bridge PCE**  

- **ECNN (Epistemic Convolutional Neural Networks)** embody the RLA paradigm in Artificial Intelligence, reinterpreting CNNs as multilevel networks.
- Pooling is the canonical form of non-injective collapse, while an additional epistemic channel emits unknown or contradiction states, transforming logical limits into computable prudence and ensuring a falsifiable interface.
- **PCE (Principle of Computational Equivalence, Wolfram)**: acts as a testbed and diagnostics. Through a constructive mapping (Φ), compact RLA/ECNN networks can be translated into 1D cellular automata, where the presence of Turing-likeness and irreducibility corresponds to class IV/V dynamics (edge ​​of chaos).
- **Final thesis**: consciousness by design: not based on the order of neuronal magnitude, but on the topology of transmissions between functional components orchestrated towards an epistemic oracle. Artificial consciousness is here hypothesized as a compact reticular configuration, capable of self-limitation and meta-reflection
